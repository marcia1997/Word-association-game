I decide to use the drag and drop interaction with jqueryui:
https://jqueryui.com/draggable/ 

Also use the id parameters to asign a different "name" to each droppable and draggable items.but by identify them but they own assigned "mark".

In conjunction with jqueryui,I implement the function(e,ui),taking the e value as the data one and the ui value as the one which is going to be changed to event.
